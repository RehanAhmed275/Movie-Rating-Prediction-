# Movie Rating Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the ratings of movies based on features such as genre, director, actors, year, duration, and votes. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics. The project involves data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information about movies, such as name, year, duration, genre, rating, votes, director, and actors.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Extracting relevant information from columns like 'Year,' encoding categorical variables based on mean ratings, and preparing features for modeling.

3. **Model Training:** Building regression models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, to predict movie ratings.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 Score.

5. **Visualizations:** Creating scatter plots and distribution plots to visualize the relationship between actual and predicted ratings.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
